## Improvements
- Create multiple windows for different screens in a multi-monitor setup

## Issues
- Every once in a while, the brightness stops responding...
- Robot.js [will not run on Electron](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/675)

## Notes
- [rebuild.js](./rebuild.js) is used to build the correct version of robot.js for Electron
